Convert images to ASCII art using Python! 🐍

## Description ℹ️

Image2ASCII is a Python script that converts images into ASCII art. It reads an image file, resizes it, converts it to grayscale, and then maps the pixel values to ASCII characters. The resulting ASCII art is displayed on the console and saved to a text file. 🎨

## Features ✨

- Convert images to ASCII art.
- Resize images to adjust the width.
- Convert images to grayscale for better representation.
- Save the generated ASCII art to a text file. 💾
